# swarm_chat

**************
Usage
A swarm has many drones and only one queen. The queen's interface has a mask to ask a question. Only drones can propose answers and discuss the matter privately for a short time. Afterwards, one answer is presented to the queen.

Don't read queen's questions as questions to you personally. All questions are addressed to the swarm. Think as a drone, a borg member of a hive-mind. An example: If the queen asks for your name: "What is your name?" Then she wants to know the name of the swarm. The name, the swarm gives itself. The swarm chat is best used with more than seven drones.

**************
Ranks
A drone can reach 5 ranks:

INVISIBLE: A drone starts invisible.
VISIBLE: Every drone, that supported an accepted proposal gets this promotion.
RESPONSIBLE: A responsible drone flagged succsessfully a proposal.
RESPECTED: A respected drone created a proposal that got at least 5% of the votes.
FAMOUS: Famous drones proposed sucsessfully an answer.

**************
Flags

be careful 
Drones may set this flag, if in their opinion, this proposal is harmful against a minority.
If at least 5% of all drones that voted on this propossal set this flag, it counts as a minority-proposal: Any negative vote sets the whole voting-sum to 0.
Data Protection
All data is saved in the swarm. There is no database on the server. No cookies are set. All known data of a drone is stored in the client browser's local storage. This data is being sent to the server in case of a server reboot. All data of past queen's questions and proposals are deleted immediately after sending the result to the swarm. In the case of contradicting information of drones, the server uses the information that is sent from more drones or in the case of equal numbers, from the drone that sent the data first.
